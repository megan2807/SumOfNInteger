# Sum of N Integers C++ Program

This is a simple C++ console application that demonstrates how to create and use a function to calculate the sum of all positive integers from 1 up to a specified number `n`.

## How it Works

The program defines a function named `sumToN` that takes one integer argument (`n`). Inside this function, a `for` loop iterates from 1 to `n`, adding each number to a running total. The final sum is then returned by the function.

The `main` function then calls `sumToN` with a predefined value (e.g., 4) and prints the result to the console.

## Example Usage

If `sumToN(4)` is called, the calculation is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.

Expected Output:
10

## Getting Started

To compile and run this program:

1.  **Save the code**: Save the C++ code (from `main.cpp`) in a directory.
2.  **Compile**: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the source file:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o sum_calculator
    ```
3.  **Run**: Execute the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./sum_calculator
    ```
